## What changes we made from the proposal?
1. The folders and recipes list cannot be reordered and cannot change name. However, we add the animations of the folder when deleting.
2. We didn't use the image detected machine learning algorithm in my fridge page. However, we remain the part of taking the picture of the ingredients.
3. We didn't use QuickChart API to show the nutrition of the recipes.
